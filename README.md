# marrero_105428_project01_Python-NAKE
#HELLO, my name is Jorge E. Marrero Torres. This is project #1 which is my first pyhton game. I was inspired by the SNAKE game, at first I started with the basics. I created functions, which I learned during class. Functions at Python are way more easy than c++ functions. I also did if statements. The game runs properly, however I had to add an import called keyboard. I started to make the game using getKey() but for some reason it didn't run. I'm still trying to making it run using getKey, but since the project is for this week and I have another project that I need to start, I'll leave the getKey stand by. Okay, the base algorithm is pretty straight forward. The base goal of the game is to control the Python $nake to move and collect fruits in a map. The movement is runned by a function with keyboard. If the snake runs out of space the game will automatically display GAME OVER! but don't worry you can run the program again and star over. Also, I started to make another game inspired by FlappyBird. However, I wanted to submit that one, but I need more time with it.
